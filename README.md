# Water-Quality-Classification-ML
This project uses machine learning to classify water quality based on physicochemical and biological parameters. District-wise pH analysis and data preprocessing were performed to understand variations and improve data quality. Multiple models were evaluated to predict safe and unsafe water conditions.
